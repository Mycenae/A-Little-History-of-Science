# CHAPTER 1 In the Beginning 第1章 在最初的时候

Science is special. It's the best way we have of finding out about the world and everything in it - and that includes us.

科学是非常特殊的，它是我们探索世界，探索世界上所有事物，包括我们自身的最好方法。

People have been asking questions about what they have seen around them for thousands of years. The answers they have come up with have changed a lot. So has science itself. Science is dynamic, building upon the ideas and discoveries which one generation passes on to the next, as well as making huge leaps forward when completely new discoveries are made. What hasn't changed is the curiosity, imagination and intelligence of those doing science. We might know more today, but people who thought deeply about their world 3,000 years ago were just as smart as we are.

几千年来，人们一直对观察到的周边的事物提出各种问题，给出的答案改变了很多，科学本身也是。科学是动态的，建立在一代传给一代的思想和发现的基础上，也包括当有全新的发现时得到巨大的进步。没有改变的是好奇心、想象力和进行科学研究的人的智力。我们今天可能知道的更多，但3000年前对周围世界进行深度思考的人和我们是一样聪明的。

This book isn't only about microscopes and test tubes in laboratories, although that is what most people think of when they think of science. For most of human history, science has been used alongside magic, religion and technology to try to understand and control the world. Science might be something as simple as observing the sun rise each morning, or as complicated as identifying a new chemical element. Magic could be looking at the stars to foretell the future, or maybe what we would call a superstition, like keeping out of the path of a black cat. Religion might lead you to sacrifice an animal to appease the gods, or to pray for world peace. Technology might involve knowing how to light a fire or build a new computer.

这本书虽然是大多数人想到科学时所指的那些事，但也不仅是关于实验室中的显微镜和试管。在人类历史的大多数时间里，科学是与巫术、宗教、技术一起来理解并控制这个世界的。科学可能很简单，就像每天早上观察太阳升起，也可能很复杂，就像发现一种新的化学元素。巫术可能是看着星星对未来作出预言，或者我们所说的迷信，就像不要去走黑猫走过的路。宗教可能是引领你用一头动物作为牺牲来吸引诸神，或祈祷世界和平。技术则是像怎样生一堆火或怎样制造一台计算机。

Science, magic, religion and technology were used by the earliest human societies that settled in river valleys across India, China and the Middle East. The river valleys were fertile, which allowed crops to be planted each year, enough to feed a large community. This allowed some people in these communities enough time to focus on one thing, to practice and practice, and become expert at it. The first 'scientists' (though they wouldn't have been called that at the time) were probably priests.

印度、中国和中东河谷边居住的最早人类社会都使用过科学、巫术、宗教和技术。这些河谷土地肥沃，可以每年种植出足够的农作物养活一个大的集体。这使这个集体中的一些人可以专注在一件事情上，不断的进行练习，进而变成专家。最早的“科学家”（虽然当时还没有这种称呼）很可能就是祭司。

In the beginning, technology (which is about 'doing') was more important than science (which is about 'knowing'). You need to know what to do, and how to do it, before you can successfully grow your crops, make your clothes, or cook your food. You don't need to know why some berries are poisonous, or some plants edible, to learn how to avoid the one and grow the other. You don't have to have a reason why the sun rises each morning and sets each evening, for these things to happen, each and every day. But human beings are not only able to learn things about the world around them, they are also curious, and that curiosity lies at the heart of science.

在最初的时候，技术（关于“做”）是比科学（关于“知”）重要的。你需要知道去做什么，怎么做，然后才能成功的生长作物，缝制衣服，烹制食物。你不需要知道为什么有的浆果是有毒的，有的植物是可以吃的，不知道为什么同样可以种植可以吃的，不种有毒的。你也不需要知道太阳每个早上升起，晚上落下，因为这种事情每天都在发生。但人类不止能从身边的世界了解事物，人类还是好奇的，好奇心是科学核心内容。

We know more about the people of Babylon (in present-day Iraq) than we do about other ancient civilizations, for a simple reason: they wrote on clay tablets. Thousands of these tablets, written almost 6,000 years ago, have survived. They tell us how the Babylonians viewed their world. They were extremely organized, keeping careful records of their harvests, stores, and state finances. The priests spent much of their time looking after the facts and figures of ancient life. They were also the main ‘scientists’, surveying land, measuring distances, viewing the sky, and developing techniques for counting. We still use some of their discoveries today. Like us, they used tally marks to keep count; this is when you make four vertical marks and cross through these diagonally with a fifth, which you might have seen in cartoons of a prison cell, made by the prisoners keeping count of how many years they have been locked up. Far more importantly, it was the Babylonians who said there should be sixty seconds in a minute and sixty minutes in an hour, as well as 360 degrees in a circle and seven days in the week. It is funny to think that there is no real reason why sixty seconds make a minute, and seven days make a week. Other numbers would have worked just as well. But the Babylonian system got picked up elsewhere and it has stuck.

我们了解巴比伦人（现在的伊拉克）比其他古文明更多，因为一个简单的原因：他们在粘土板上写字。6000年前书写的数千个板子保留了下来，这告诉了我们巴比伦人如何看待这个世界。他们组织的非常好，小心的记录他们的收成、库存和国家经济。祭司大部分时间都用在照看古代生活中的事实和数字。他们也是主要的科学家，调查土地，测量距离，观察天象，发展计数的方法。今天我们仍然在使用他们的一些发现。就像我们一样，他们用标记计数，就像做了4个竖的标记，然后沿对角线斜穿过这些标记作为5，你可能在卡通片的监狱里见过，犯人会用这种方法来计算他们待了多少年。更重要的是，巴比伦人还采用了60秒作为一分钟，60分钟为一小时，一个圆有360度，一个星期有7天。想想会觉得非常可笑，没有什么真正的原因为什么一分钟会是60秒，一个星期要有7天，其他数也是可以的。但巴比伦的这套系统在别的地方也得到了使用，而且沿用了下来。

The Babylonians were good at astronomy - that is, examining the heavens. Over many years they began to recognize patterns in the positions of stars and planets in the sky at night. They believed that the earth was at the centre of things, and that there were powerful-magical-connections between us and the stars. As long as people believed that the earth was the centre of the universe, they didn't count it as a planet. They divided the night sky into twelve parts, and gave each part a name associated with certain groups (or 'constellations') of stars. Through a heavenly game of Join-the-dots, the Babylonians saw pictures of objects and animals in some constellations, such as a set of scales and a scorpion. This was the first Zodiac, the basis of astrology, which is the study of the influence of the stars upon us. Astrology and astronomy were closely linked in ancient Babylon and for many centuries afterwards. Many people today know which sign of the Zodiac they were born under (I am a Taurus, the bull) and read their horoscopes in newspapers and magazines for advice about their lives. But astrology is not part of modern science.

巴比伦人还非常擅长天文学，就是观察天象。经过很多年的积累，他们逐渐识别出了夜晚恒星和行星位置的很多图案，他们相信地球处于其中心，我们与星星之间存在着很强的魔法般的联系。只要人们还将地球看作是宇宙的中心，就不可能将其算作行星。他们将夜空分为12部分，每个部分都以其中的一些星座命名。通过这种天空中连线的游戏，巴比伦人在天空中将星座画成了一些物体和动物，比如天平和蝎子。这是第一个黄道十二宫图，占星术的基础，占星学研究星星对我们的影响。占星术和天文学在古巴比伦时期以及其后的很多个世纪联系紧密。今天的很多人他们出生在哪个星座（我是金牛座），在报纸上观看他们的星象，在杂志中寻找生活的建议，但占星术不是现代科学的一部分。

The Babylonians were only one of several powerful groups in the ancient Middle East. We know most about the Egyptians, who settled along the River Nile as early as 3,500 BC. No civilization before or since was so dependent on a single natural feature. The Egyptians relied on the Nile for their very existence, for every year as the mighty river flooded it brought rich silt to replenish the land around its banks, and so prepare it for the next year's crops. Egypt is very hot and dry, so a lot of things have survived for us to admire and learn from today, including many pictures, and a kind of pictorial writing, called hieroglyphics. After Egypt was conquered first by the Greeks and then by the Romans, the ability to read and write hieroglyphs disappeared, and so for almost 2,000 years the meaning of their writing was lost. Then, in 1798, a French soldier found a round tablet in a pile of old rubble in a little town near Rosetta, in the north of Egypt. It had a proclamation written in three languages: hieroglyphics, Greek, and an even older form of Egyptian writing called demotics. The Rosetta Stone came to London, where you can see it today in the British Museum. What a breakthrough! Scholars could read the Greek and therefore translate the hieroglyphs, decoding the mysterious Egyptian writing. Now we could really begin to learn about the ancient Egyptians' beliefs and practices.

巴比伦人只是古中东几个强大群体中的一个。我们对埃及人知道的最多，他们早在公元前3500年就在尼罗河畔定居。此前或此后没有哪个文明这么依赖一种自然现象，埃及人靠尼罗河为生，因为每年这条伟大的河流都会泛滥，从而带来肥沃的淤泥，填满河岸周围的土地，为下一年的耕作做好准备。埃及炎热干燥，所以留下了很多今天的我们敬仰和学习的东西，包括很多图画，和一种画画似的笔记，也称象形文字。在埃及先被希腊然后被罗马征服以后，象形文字的阅读和写作能力没有了，所以他们文字的意义丢失了2000年。然后，在1798年，一个法国士兵在埃及北部罗塞塔附近的一个小镇上，从一堆古老的碎砖堆中，找到了一个圆形的石板，有一个公告用三种语言进行了书写：象形文字，希腊语和一种更古老的埃及书写体称为“通俗文字”。罗塞塔石到了伦敦，现在可以在英国博物馆中看到。真是一个突破！学者可以阅读希腊文，因此可以翻译那些象形文字，对神秘的埃及文字进行解密。现在我们真的可以知道古老埃及的信仰和实践。

Egyptian astronomy was similar to the Babylonians', but Egyptian concern with the afterlife meant that they were more practical in their stargazing. The calendar was very important, not only to tell them when it was the best time to plant, or when to expect the Nile to flood, but also to plan religious festivals. Their 'natural' year was 360 days - that is, twelve months made up of three weeks lasting ten days each - and they added an extra five days at the end of the year to keep the seasons from slipping. The Egyptians thought that the universe was shaped like a rectangular box, with their world at the base of the box, and the Nile flowing exactly through the centre of that world. The beginning of their year coincided with the flooding of the Nile, and they eventually linked it with the nightly rising of the brightest star in the night sky, which we call Sirius.

埃及天文学家与巴比伦的相似，但埃及人关注的是后世，这就意味着在凝望星空中更加注意实践。历法非常重要，不仅告诉人们何时是最佳种植时间，何时期盼尼罗河泛滥，也告诉人们何时准备宗教节日。自然的年份是360天，也就是12个月，每个月3个星期，每个星期10天，每年最后还追加了5天以防季节紊乱。埃及人认为宇宙就像一个方形的盒子，他们的世界在盒子的底部，尼罗河穿过正中间。一年开始于尼罗河泛滥之时，最终与夜晚升起最亮的星星，也就是天狼星，联系到了一起。

As in Babylon, the priests were important in the courts of the Pharaohs, the Egyptian rulers. The Pharaohs were considered to be divine, and able to enjoy a life after death. This is one reason why they constructed the pyramids, which are really gigantic funeral monuments. Pharaohs, their relatives and other important people, along with servants, dogs, cats, furniture and food supplies, were placed in these massive structures to await new life in the next world. To preserve the bodies of important people (after all, it wouldn't do to turn up in the afterlife rotten and stinking) the Egyptians developed ways of embalming the dead. This meant first of all removing the internal organs (they had a long hook for scooping out the brain through the nostrils) and placing them in special jars. Chemicals were used to preserve the rest of the body, which was then wrapped in linen and put in its final resting place in its tomb.

像在巴比伦一样，祭司在法老（埃及的统治者）的宫廷里非常重要。法老是神圣的，在死后可以享受生活。这也是为什么他们建筑了金字塔，真是非常宏大的陵墓。法老及其亲戚，还有其他重要人物，连同仆人、狗、猫、家具以及食物供应，都放置在这个宏大的建筑中，等待下一个世界的新生。为了保存重要人物的遗体（毕竟不能腐烂发臭的出现在后世中），埃及人发明了尸体防腐的方法。首先去除内脏（他们有一种钩子可以将人脑从鼻孔中钩出来），然后放置在特殊的罐子里。用化学物质保护剩余的遗体，当时是用亚麻包裹，然后放置在坟墓中的最终休息处。

Embalmers would have had a pretty good idea of what the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys looked like. Unfortunately, they did not describe the organs that they removed, so we don't know what they thought the organs did. However, other medical papyri have survived, and these do tell us about Egyptian medicine and surgery. As was common at the time, the Egyptians believed a mix of religious, magical and natural things caused diseases. Healers would have recited spells while giving their remedies to patients. But many of the cures invented by the Egyptians do seem to have come from careful observation of illnesses. Some of the medicines they put on dressings for wounds after injury or surgery might well have kept the wound free from germs and so aided healing. This was thousands of years before we even knew what germs were.

对尸体做防腐处理的人肯定对人的心脏、肺、肝脏和肾脏有很多了解。不幸的是，他们没有描述移除的器官，所以我们也不知道他们心目中的那些器官的样子。但其他的医用纸莎草纸留了下来，这的确告诉了我们不少关于埃及医药和手术的情况。当时的通常情况是，埃及人相信宗教、巫术和自然的综合情况会导致疾病。治疗者会一边复述咒语，一边给病人治疗。但很多埃及人发明的治疗方法看起来确实是从对病情的仔细观察中得到的。一些用于处理外伤或手术伤口的药确实避免病菌感染，帮助了治疗。这是在我们知道什么是病菌那时的几千年前。

At this stage of history, counting, astronomy and medicine were the three most obvious 'scientific' fields of activity. Counting, because you need to know 'how many' before you can plant enough crops and trade with other people, or to see if you have enough soldiers or pyramid builders at your disposal. Astronomy, because the sun, moon and stars are so closely related to the days, months and seasons, that carefully noting their positions is fundamental for calendars. Medicine, because when people fall sick or are injured, they naturally seek help. But in each of these cases, magic, religion, technology and science were mixed, and for these ancient Middle Eastern civilizations, we have to guess a lot about why people did what they did, or how ordinary people went about their daily lives. Ordinary people are always difficult to know about, since it was mostly powerful people, who could read and write, who have left the records of history. This was also true in two other ancient civilizations that started at about the same time, but in faraway Asia: China and India.

在历史的这个阶段，计数、天文学和医学是三项最明显的科学活动。计数，是因为需要知道要种植“多少”作物才够，需要知道与别人交易“多少”东西，需要知道“多少”士兵/金字塔建造者才足够。天文学，是因为太阳、月亮和星星与每天、每个月和季节是紧密联系在一起的，小心的标记出它们的位置是历法的基础。医学，是因为当人们生病或受伤时，他们自然的会寻求帮助。但在各种情况下，巫术、宗教、技术和科学是混在一起的，对于这些古中东文明，对于他们做了什么，为什么做，他们的日常生活是怎样的，我们都需要进行很多猜测。普通人是最难了解的，因为是那些会读和写的最强大的人留下了历史的记录。同时期远在亚洲存在的两个古文明，中国和印度，也是类似的情形。
