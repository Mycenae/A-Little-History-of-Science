# CHAPTER 4 the Father of Medicine: Hippocrates
# 第4章 医学之父：希波克拉底

The next time you have to see the doctor, ask if he or she took the Hippocratic Oath at their graduation ceremony. Not all modern medical schools require their students to recite it, but some do, and this oath, written more than 2,000 years ago, has something to say to us still. We shall see what that is shortly.

下次必须要看医生的时候，问问他或她在毕业典礼上有没有说过希波克拉底誓言。并不是所有的医学院都要求学生背诵，但有一些确实要求，而且这个2000多年前写成的誓言，仍然可以告诉我们一些东西。我们简单的来看看这是什么。

Even though Hippocrates' name is attached to this famous oath, he probably didn't write it. In fact, he wrote only a few of the sixty or so treatises (short books on specific topics) that bear his name. We know only a little about Hippocrates the man. He was born about 460 BC, on the island of Cos, not far from present-day Turkey. He practiced as a doctor, taught medicine (for money) and probably had two sons and a son-in-law who all were doctors. There is a long history of medicine being a family tradition.

尽管这个著名的誓言以希波克拉底的名字命名，但他很可能并没有写出这个誓言。实际上，以他名字为作者的约60篇论文专著中，他也只写了一部分而已。我们对希波克拉底这个人所知甚少。他大约生于公元前460年，出生地点在Cos岛上，距今天的土耳其不远。他是一个医生，教授医学（为了钱），很可能有两个儿子和一个女婿都是医生。他们家族的医生历史是非常长的。

The Hippocratic Corpus (a corpus is a group of writings) was actually written by many individuals, over a long period of time, perhaps as long as 250 years. The various treatises in the Corpus argue different points of view, and they deal with lots of different matters. These include diagnosing and treating diseases, how to cope with broken bones and dislocated joints, epidemics, how to stay healthy, what to eat, and how the environment can influence our health. The treatises also help doctors know how to behave, both with their patients and with other doctors. In short, the Hippocratic writings cover just about the whole of medicine as it was practiced at the time.

希波克拉底文集实际上是很多人经过了很长时间，可能有250年才写成的。文集中的各种论文讨论了很多不同观点，处理了很多不同的情况。这包括诊断、治疗疾病，怎样处理骨折和关节错位，时疫，怎样保持健康，吃什么，环境怎样影响我们的健康状况。文章还给出了医生的行为参考，包括如何对待病人，以及如何与其他医生相处。简短来说，希波克拉底文集包括了那个时代医学里的所有内容。

Just as remarkable as the range of subjects covered is how long ago the treatises were written. Hippocrates lived before Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and on Cos, a small, remote island. It is amazing that anything written so long ago survives at all. There were no printing presses, and words had to be copied laboriously by hand on parchment, scrolls, clay and other surfaces, and then passed from person to person. Ink fades, wars lead to destruction, and insects and weather take their toll. We generally have only copies of those writings, made much later by generations of interested people. The more copies that were made, the greater the chance that some of them would survive.

文集覆盖的范围之广让人印象深刻，其成文之早也让人感叹。希波克拉底生活在苏格拉底、柏拉图、亚里士多德之前，而且是在偏远狭小的Cos岛上。这么久之前写成的任何东西能流传下来都让人非常惊奇。没有任何出版社，这些言语都必须辛苦的手工抄写，在羊皮纸、卷轴、黏土和其他物质的表面上，然后在人与人之间传递。墨水会褪色，战争会导致毁灭，昆虫和天气都会造成损伤。我们只是有这些著作的复制版，这是由很久以后对其感兴趣的后代制作而成的。复制的数量越多，能流传下来的几率就越大。

The Hippocratic treatises laid the foundation of Western medicine, and therefore Hippocrates still occupies a special position. Three broad principles have guided medical practice for centuries. The first still underpins our own medicine and medical science: the firm belief that people fall ill because of 'natural' causes that have rational explanations. Before the Hippocratics, in Greece and its neighboring lands, disease was assumed to have a supernatural dimension. We fall ill because we have offended the gods, or because someone with unearthly powers cast a spell on us, or is displeased with us. And if witches, magicians and gods caused disease, it was best to leave priests or magicians to figure out why the disease had happened and how best to cure it. Many people, even today, use magical remedies, and faith-healers are still with us.

希波克拉底的文章打下了西医的基础，所以希波克拉底仍然占据了一个特殊的位置。有三条主要的原则引领了医学发展了几个世纪。第一条原则仍然在支撑着我们医疗科学：人们生病是有自然的原因的，是有着可以推理的解释的。在希波克拉底之前，在希腊及其邻邦，疾病被认为是非自然的原因导致的。我们生病是因为冒犯了天神，或者某个有可怕力量的人对病人施放了一个咒语，或者对病人感到生气。如果女巫、术士和天神导致了疾病，最好让祭司或术士来找到发病的原因，怎么才能治愈。即使今天仍然有很多人使用魔法类的治疗方法，我们之中仍然也有信仰治疗者。

The Hippocratics were not priest-healers, they were doctors, who believed that disease was a natural, normal event. One treatise, On the Sacred Disease, shows this very clearly. This short work is about epilepsy, a common disorder then as now: we think both Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar suffered from the condition. People with epilepsy have fits, during which they can become unconscious and experience muscle-twitching, and their bodies twist about. Sometimes, they wet themselves. Gradually, the fit subsides and they regain control of their bodies and mental functions. Those who suffer from epilepsy nowadays look upon it as a 'normal', if inconvenient, episode. But seeing someone during an epileptic fit can be pretty disturbing, and so dramatic and mysterious were the seizures that the ancient Greeks assumed the condition had a divine cause. So they called it the 'Sacred Disease'.

希波克拉底学派的人不是祭司治疗者，他们是医生，他们相信疾病是自然的正常的事件。《神圣疾病论》论文非常清楚的展示了这一点。这个短文是关于癫痫的，现在是一种普通的失调：我们认为亚历山大大帝和凯撒都被这种情况困扰。癫痫患者有发作的时候，发作时他们会变得无意识，经历肌肉痉挛，身体扭在一起。有时候，还会小便失禁。慢慢的，发作会平息，患者又可以控制自己的身体和意识。现在的癫痫患者认为这种情况是比较正常的阶段，只是不太方便而已。但看到患者癫痫发作还是会非常不舒服，这种癫痫发作非常神秘而戏剧化，古希腊人认为这种情况肯定有一个神圣的原因。所以他们称之为“神圣的疾病”。

The Hippocratic author of the treatise was having none of this. His famous opening sentence states bluntly, ‘I do not believe that the "Sacred Disease" is any more divine or sacred than any other disease, but, on the contrary, has specific characteristics and a definite cause. Nevertheless, because it is completely different from other diseases, it has been regarded as a divine visitation by those who, being only human, view it with ignorance and astonishment’. The author's theory was that epilepsy is caused by a blockage of phlegm in the brain. Like most theories in science and medicine, better ones have replaced it. But the firm statement - that you can't say a disease has a supernatural cause simply because it is unusual or mysterious or hard to explain - might be said to be the guiding principle of science throughout the ages. We may not understand it now, but with patience and hard work, we can. This argument is one of the most lasting things handed down to us by the Hippocratics.

希波克拉底学派论文的作者不这么认为。他的著名开场论断坦率的指出：“我不相信‘神圣疾病’比其他疾病更神圣，相反，肯定有特殊的性质和确切的原因。尽管这样，由于这和其他疾病都不一样，所以那些无知和震惊的人认为这是神圣的。”作者的理论是癫痫由大脑中的粘液质被堵塞所导致。就像科学与医学中的大部分理论一样，总有更好的理论替代。但你不能因为一种疾病不寻常或神秘或难以解释而说这病是超自然的原因导致的，这个牢固的论断可以说是几个时代以来科学的引领规则。我们可能现在不理解，但只要有耐心、努力工作，我们会理解的。这是希波克拉底学派流传给我们的最有持久力的论断。

The second Hippocratic principle was that both health and diseases are caused by the 'humours' in our bodies. (An old expression is that someone is in a good or bad humour, meaning in a good or bad mood.) This idea is most clearly set out in the treatise On the Nature of Man, which might have been written by Hippocrates' son-in-law. Several other Hippocratic works mention two humours - phlegm and yellow bile - as the causes of disease. On the Nature of Man added two more: blood and black bile. The author argued that these four humours play essential roles in our health, and when they get out of balance (when there is too much or too little of one or the other) then disease occurs. You've probably seen your own bodily fluids when you've been ill. When we have a fever, we break out in a sweat; when we have a cold or chest infection, our noses run and we cough up phlegm. When we have upset tummies, we vomit, and diarrhoea expels fluids from the other end. A scrape or cut can cause the skin to bleed. Less common today is jaundice, when the skin turns yellow. Jaundice can be caused by many diseases affecting those organs that make the bodily fluids, including malaria, which was common in ancient Greece.

第二条希波克拉底原则是我们身体的健康或疾病都是体内体液情况的结果（一句老话是某人“体液”好或坏，意思就是脾气好或坏）。这个论点在文章《论人的性质》中阐述的很清楚，其作者可能是希波克拉底的女婿。其他几篇希波克拉底的著作提到了黏液和黄胆汁这两种体液会导致一些疾病。《论人的性质》中又加了两种：血液和黑胆汁。作者认为，这四种体液在我们的健康中扮演重要的角色，当他们失去平衡（当一种或几种体液过多或过少）那么就会导致疾病。在你生病时，肯定已经见过自己的一些体液。当我们发烧时，我们突然开始出汗；当我们感冒或肺部感染时，我们开始流鼻涕，然后咳嗽出痰。我们肚子不舒服时，我们会呕吐，腹泻时会不断的拉稀。刮伤或其他伤口导致皮肤流血。今天比较少见的情况是黄疸，那时皮肤会变黄。很多疾病感染了制造体液的器官时会导致黄疸，包括疟疾，这在古希腊的时候是很常见的。

The Hippocratics associated each of these humours with an organ in the body: blood with the heart, yellow bile with the liver, black bile with the spleen, and phlegm with the brain. The author of On the Sacred Disease thought that epilepsy was caused by blocked phlegm in the brain. Other diseases, not just ones such as colds or diarrhoea with their obvious changes in fluids, were associated with changes in the humours. Each of the humours had its properties: blood is hot and moist; phlegm, cold and moist; yellow bile, hot and dry; black bile, cold and dry. These kinds of symptoms can actually be seen in those who are ill: when a wound is inflamed with blood, it's hot, and when we have a runny cold we feel cold and shiver. (Galen, who developed Hippocratic ideas about 600 years later, also gave these same characteristics of hot, cold, moist and dry to the foods we eat, or drugs we might take.)

希波克拉底学派将每种体液都与身体内的一种器官关联起来：血液和心脏，黄胆汁和肝，黑胆汁和脾，黏液和脑子。《论神圣疾病》的作者认为癫痫是由于大脑中的黏液收到阻隔所导致的。其他疾病，其他疾病，不止像感冒或腹泻这种有明显体液变化的病，都与体液的变化有关系。每种体液都有其性质：血是热、潮湿的，黏液是冷而潮湿的，黄胆汁是热而干的，黑胆汁是冷而干的。这些症状都可以在病人身上看到：当伤口流血发炎时，是非常热的，当我们感冒流鼻涕时，我们感到很冷，并且打颤。（600年后继续发展希波克拉底思想的Galen，将我们吃的食物或药物也赋予了热、冷、潮湿、干燥的不同性质。）

The cure for all illnesses was to restore whatever balance of humours was best for each patient. That meant that in practice Hippocratic medicine was more complicated than simply following instructions to return each humour back to its 'natural' state. Each individual patient had his or her own healthy balance of the humours, so the doctor had to know all about his patient: where they lived, what they ate, how they earned their living. Only by knowing his patient well could he tell the patient what was likely to happen, that is, give them a prognosis. When we are sick, we want most of all to know what to expect, and how we might get better. Hippocratic doctors placed great store in being able to predict just what would happen. Getting that right increased their reputations and brought them more patients.

要治疗病症，就必须恢复每个病人本身的体液平衡。这意味着实践中希波克拉底派医学比遵循简单的恢复病人的体液到其自然状态要复杂。每个病人健康状态的体液平衡都是不一样的，所以医生要知道病人所有的状态：住在哪里，吃什么食物，靠什么赚钱生活。只有知道的病人的信息越多，才能知道病人将会怎样，也就是准确的预测。当我们生病时，我们最想知道将会怎样，怎么才能改善病情。希波克拉底派医生在预测病人病情发展方面有很多经验，能准确的预测病情增加了他们的信誉，让更多病人相信他们。

The medicine that the Hippocratics learned, and then taught to their pupils (often their sons or sons-in-law), was based on careful observation of diseases and the course they took. They wrote down their experiences, often in the form of short summaries called ‘aphorisms’. Aphorisms was one of the Hippocratic works most widely used by later doctors.

希波克拉底学派学到的医术随后又教给了他们的学生（通常是他们的儿子或女婿），这些医术是通过对病情的仔细观察得到的，也是通过对病人的治疗得到的。他们写下经验，通常以“格言警句”这种简短的经验的形式。后世的医生广泛的用到了希波克拉底学派的“格言警句”。

The Hippocratics' third important approach to health and disease was summarized by the Latin phrase vis medicatrix naturae, which means ‘the healing power of nature’. Hippocrates and his followers interpreted the movements of humours during disease as signs of the body's attempt to heal itself. So sweating, bringing up phlegm, vomiting and the pus of abscesses were viewed as the body expelling - or 'cooking' (they used kitchen metaphors a lot) - the humours. The body did this to get rid of excesses or modify or purify bad humours that had been changed by disease. The doctor's job was therefore to assist nature in the natural healing process. The doctor was nature's servant, not her master, and the processes of disease were to be learned by close observation of exactly what occurred during disease. Much later, one doctor coined the phrase 'self-limited disease' to describe this tendency, and we all know that many illnesses get better by themselves. Doctors sometimes joke among themselves that if they treat a disease it will be gone in a week, but if they don't it will take seven days. The Hippocratics would have agreed.

希波克拉底学派第三个重要的原则以拉丁文总结如此，vis medicatrix naturae，意为“自然的治愈力量”。希波克拉底和他的追随者将发病期间体液的运动解释为身体要治愈自己的努力。所以出汗将痰带出来，呕吐，脓肿的脓汁都是身体驱除（或“烹调”，他们用了很多做饭方面的隐喻）体液的行为。身体的这些行为是在摆脱多余的、修正或净化坏的体液，疾病让这些体液变坏了。所以医生的责任就是在身体自然治愈的过程中协助自然之力。医生只是自然的仆人，而不是自然的主宰，疾病的知识就在对发病及治疗过程的仔细观察中得到。很久以后，一个医生创造了“自限疾病”这个词语来描述这种趋势，我们都知道很多疾病都会自己慢慢变好。医生有时候开玩笑说，如果治疗了一个疾病会在一周内治好，如果不治疗的话，七天也就变好了。希波克拉底学派的人恐怕会同意这个说法。

Besides their many works on medicine and surgery, hygiene and epidemics, the Hippocratics left us the Oath, still a source of inspiration to doctors today. Some of this short document is concerned with the relationships between the young student and his master, and between doctors. Much of it, however, deals with the appropriate behavior that doctors ought to adopt with their patients. They ought never to take advantage of their patients, gossip about secrets they might hear from the sick, or administer a poison. All these issues are still vital in medical ethics today, but one Hippocratic statement in the Oath seems particularly timeless: I will use my power to help the sick to the best of my ability and judgment; I will abstain from harming or wrongdoing any man by it. 'To do the sick no harm' ought still to be every doctor's aim.

除了这些医学、外科手术、卫生学、流行病的著作外，希波克拉底学派的人还给我们留下了誓言，仍然是今天医生的灵感来源。一部分文献是与学生和老师以及医生的关系有关的。但是，文献的很多内容还是关于怎么调整医生与病人的行为准则的。医生决不能占病人的便宜，不能对从病人听到的秘密八卦传播，也不能给别人毒药。所有这些问题现在仍然是关键的医疗道德问题，其中的一条希波克拉底誓言的阐述尤其显得永恒：我将使用我的能力和判断尽全力帮助病人，我将永远不对病人做有害的事。“不危害病人”仍然是每个医生的目标。
